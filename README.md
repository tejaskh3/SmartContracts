# SmartContracts

This repo contains all smart contracts that I wrote during my initial phase of learnign solidity.

These are some small but crucial projects which helped to become comfortable with solidity.

# 1.Lottery
### key points
1. Used a manager controling execution of smartcontract.
2. envoling minimum three people to at least bet .01 eth.
3. Randomly selecting a winner transfering all the funds to his/her account address.

# 2. CrowdFunding Dapp
### key points
1. created a manager, requesting for funds with specific target and deadline.
2. then asking people to donated in it.
3. If the target is not met and deadline is over then user can ask for refund.
4. If target is achieved then asking users permission to release all to funds to reciever's address.
